            <p>Platinum is a rare, silvery-white, transition metal with the chemical symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It's a member of group 10 and period 6 of the periodic table.</p>
            <p>Properties:
                Density: Platinum is very dense, with a density of 21.5 g/cm³, which is nearly 22 times denser than water. 
                Melting point: Platinum has a melting point of 1,770 °C. 
                Boiling point: Platinum has a boiling point of 3,825 °C. 
                Reactivity: Platinum is one of the least reactive metals and is resistant to corrosion, even at high temperatures. 
                Malleability: Platinum is malleable and ductile, meaning it can be stretched into wires.
            </p>
            <p>Uses:
                Jewelry: Platinum is used in jewelry like rings and watches because it's resistant to corrosion and doesn't oxidize. 
                Electronics: Platinum is used in electronic components like electrical contacts and electrodes. 
                Laboratory equipment: Platinum is used in laboratory equipment because it's resistant to corrosion and doesn't oxidize. 
                Catalytic converters: Platinum is used in catalytic converters because it's a good catalyst. 
                Glass industry: Platinum is used in the glass industry to manipulate molten glass.
            </p>
            <p>History:
                The name platinum comes from the Spanish word platina, which means "little silver". 
                Antonio de Ulloa discovered platinum in South America in 1735, and N. Wood discovered it independently in 1741. 
                Pre-Columbian Indians used platinum before it was discovered by Europeans.
            </p>
            <p>Special about Platinum:
                And with a melting point of 1,768 degrees Celsius, platinum is also much more durable than gold or silver, and highly resistant to tarnishing, 
                corrosion and wear — making it a highly sought-after metal for jewelry, electronics, and industrial and medical applications.
