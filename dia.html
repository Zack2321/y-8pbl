                <p>A heavy precious grayish white noncorroding ductile malleable metallic element that fuses with difficulty and is used especially in chemical ware and apparatus, as a catalyst, and in dental and jewelry alloys.Platinum has a range of uses, including electronics, automotive industry, dentistry equipment, jewellery, and bullion. The biggest use of platinum however is as a catalyst. Catalysts are materials that speed up chemical reactions and reduce the energy needed to convert a substance.</p>
                <p>Platinum has historically been more expensive than gold due to its rarity and industrial applications. Platinum is mined in fewer locations and is about 30 times rarer than gold. Its use in various industries, including automotive, chemical, and electronics, increases its demand, leading to higher prices.At this time, platinum in quantity is limited to a few localities. 80% of the world's current production comes from South Africa and the Sudbury Basin of Canada. Smaller reserves can be found in the United States, Zimbabwe and Australia. Platinum is also attained through recycling.</p>
